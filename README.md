# fetchData

"In this section, you’ll learn how to fetch data from external sources for React applications. You’ll start by fetching data from a file on your local machine and then you’ll fetch data from a remote URL. You’ll focus on controlling the rendering of data and the lifecycle of components. "
## Installation

- Fork the project onto your local machine

- Install a local server onto your machine

- Run the local server by entering http-server -c-1 into your terminal

## Roadmap

The two main changes I want to make will be styling the pagination component to be more user friendly, and to have the links open in a new window rather than your current tab.
